### Loot Generator
==========

This was a simple test project for teaching the GitHub workflow.

Goals of the Test Program - Loot Generator:
* Create an item that rolls a 'rarity.'
* The items rarity determines how many modifiers the item will have (1-6).
* Pull random key modifiers from a sample dictionary (mod_pool) and ensure
    that no duplicates are picked.
* Compare the key to the values of the dictionary, and give those a random number based on the type of modifier.
* Display the item in a user-friendly output.


Future Additions:
* Create a character, giving them stats as well (Static, and then eventually
    random rolls, or user-input)
* Allow the items from the Loot Generator to be equipped, and uneqipped
* Allow the item to be saved and the equipped items to be applied to a new
    object (the character).
* Show all of the following:
    * Stats of the items
    * Stats of the character
    * Stats combined into one
